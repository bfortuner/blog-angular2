	<p class="entry-desc">
	  This author grew up in the small colonial town of Litchfield, <b>Connecticut</b>. A number of uneventful things happened there. He left shortly after to attend the <b>University of Virginia</b> where he accumulated credits in cognitively undemanding subjects like business and philosophy. He also sang in an a capella group, wrote for a <b>humor publication</b>, frequented a debating society, and from time to time attended class. Despite his greatest desire to remain at the university forever, a minor administrative oversight involving the incorrect rounding of <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating_point">floats</a></b> gave him one credit too many and he was promptly graduated. Keen not to stay on his parents' futon forever, he found inspiration in the classic movie “Sleepless in <b>Seattle</b>” and decided to move there where he still lives, works, and gets wet.

		I'm a Software Engineer currently on sabbatical for side projects and travel. Previously I worked at Amazon building distributed systems to handle large data workflows. I'm also interested in Genetics, Neuroscience, AI, Eduction, IoT, and MOOCs. Outside of work I enjoy <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3966837-brendan-fortuner" target="_blank">reading</a> Isaac Asimov novels, attending Startup Weekends, cooking in my crockpot, sailing, hiking, snowboarding, and playing piano, soccer, tennis, yoga, golf and go (board game). I live in San Francisco.
